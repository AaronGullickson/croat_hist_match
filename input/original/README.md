# Raw Data Files from Parish Records

The files in this subdirectory are the original baptism (birth), marriage, and death records collected by parish. All files are fixed width text files. Files ending in `.format` provide the information on fields in the actual files. All files in the `*.uni` files contain original untokenized names. The `*.w` files provide the data with tokenized names combined across all parishes for each event. 

"fname" means first or baptismal name, "lname" means last or surname.

"Book" means the catalog number of the original record book in the Archive of Croatia. "Page" is the page in that book.

Binary (yes/no) variables such as the legitimacy of a birth are coded 1 for positive, 0 for negative. Other codes are indicated in the format files.

The website files do not include the "comment" codes, which were primarily used to alert us during data entry.

"Parish" in the *.uni files is inherent in the file name. In the *.w files it is indicated by the initial letter of the parish name.

Users should note that parishes begin and end recording for different events at different times and that there are occasional gaps in the data where events were not recovered.
